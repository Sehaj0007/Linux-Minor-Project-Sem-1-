The goal of this project is to develop a GUI-based automation tool for network scanning using Nmap. This tool enables users to initiate and view results of different types of network scans, providing insights into open ports and potential security vulnerabilities.
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free, open-source network scanning tool that helps users map networks, identify hosts, and perform security audits. It is used by network administrators, mid and large companies, and smaller organizations for a variety of tasks, including penetration testing, red and blue team exercises, and host monitoring.
The Nmap Automation Tool is built using Python, leveraging the nmap and tkinter libraries. The tool provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the execution of various Nmap scans, including SYN ACK, UDP, and Comprehensive scans. Users can enter an IP address, select a scan type, and view the scan results, making network diagnostics more accessible and efficient.
